# try! Swift 2016 Presentation
## Prototyping Animation

This is all the sample code I used in my presentation at [try! Swift 2016](http://www.tryswift.com), so be sure to check out my talk when it's posted! :D

Example includes a playground that shows making a pokédex that has really animated pokéballs to present pokémon.

Feel free to check out the presentation folder to see slides, and a video will be appended when it's ready! :D
